LipBuddy is a deep learning-based lip-reading application that leverages advanced computer vision and natural language processing techniques to interpret speech by analyzing lip movements. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the project integrates a Streamlit-based interface for user interaction and utilizes a pre-trained LipNet model to enhance accuracy. LipBuddy aims to aid accessibility, improve silent communication, and explore applications in surveillance and language processing tasks.
